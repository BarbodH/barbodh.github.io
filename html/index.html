      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Barbod, and I am a third-year Computer Science student at York University. I am an inherently curious individual finding great pleasure in understanding the world around me, which has fueled my ambition to pursue a career in research and development (R&D). I am also an avid gamer, enjoying both video games and classic board games.
      </p>

      <h6>Background</h6>
      <p>
        I was born in Iran and moved to Canada at the age of 14. Coming from a culturally rich background, I have great appreciation for arts and have played Persian classical music for nearly 15 years. Being an artist has taught me the values of discipline, humility, and commitment to continuous learning in order to achieve meaningful outcomes.
      </p>

      <h6>Why Computer Science?</h6>
      <p>
        Given my inquisitive nature and sense of creativity, I chose to study Computer Science. I believe that this field provides me with the means not only to better understand the technologies I constantly interact with but also to express my ideas as practical applications, addressing real-world challenges.
      </p>

      <h6>Inspiration</h6>
      <p>
        Despite having many inspirations throughout my academic career, my grade 8 mathematics and physics teacher, Mr. Rezaei, stands out for me. He was the toughest and most detail-oriented teacher I have ever had. Although I despised the harsh treatment he gave at the time, looking back, I now appreciate his intention of making me not take my natural gifts for granted and demand more from myself to achieve greatness. I am thankful to him for the substantial improvement in academic performance in the following grades, finishing my senior year with an average of 98% and maintaining straight Aâ€™s all throughout university.

      <p>
        I have been playing chess since I was five years old, way before it became a mainstream hobby during the coronavirus pandemic. It is my favourite board game as it does not involve dice or card dealing. It stands out as one of the least luck-oriented games, where any loss is solely attributed to my own decisions. It also resonates with my innovative mindset, demanding unique strategies and ideas for each game, rather than rigid, predetermined instructions.

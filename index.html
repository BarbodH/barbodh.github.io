      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>
        I am an inherently curious individual finding great pleasure in understanding the world around me, which has fueled my ambition to pursue a career in research and development (R&D). I am driven to specialize in computational mathematics and contribute to medical research. My passion revolves around utilizing advanced computing tools to further decode the human genome. It is an exciting journey where I see the opportunity to make meaningful contributions in the advancement of preventive medicine and gene therapy.
      </p>

      <h6>Background</h6>
      <p>
        I was born in Iran and moved to Canada at the age of 14. Coming from a culturally rich background, I have great appreciation for arts and have played Persian classical music for nearly 15 years. Being an artist has taught me the values of discipline, humility, and commitment to continuous learning in order to achieve meaningful outcomes.
      </p>

      <h6>Why Computer Science?</h6>
      <p>
        Given my inquisitive nature and sense of creativity, I chose to study Computer Science. I believe that this field provides me with the means not only to better understand the technologies I constantly interact with but also to express my ideas as practical applications, addressing real-world challenges.

      <p>
        <strong>Fun fact!</strong> I have been playing chess since I was five years old. It is my favourite board game as it does not involve dice or card dealing. Therefore, it stands out as one of the least luck-oriented games, where any loss is solely attributed to my own decisions.
